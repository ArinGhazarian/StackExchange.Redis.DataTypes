# StackExchange.Redis.DataTypes
Implementation of common .NET collection types (i.e IDictionary, ISet, IList) via abstraction over StackExchange.Redis. By using this library you will be able to seamlessly replace your common *in-memory* collection types with types stored in redis db. All you need to do is to instantiate a redis collection type and continue coding as if you are working with common *in-memory* collections.

# Installation
You can install this library from NuGet UI [StackExchange.Redis.DataTypes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StackExchange.Redis.DataTypes), or either of the following:

* Package manager console (Windows)
```
PM> Install-Package StackExchange.Redis.DataTypes
```
* .NET CLI (Windows, Linux, Mac)
```
> dotnet add package StackExchange.Redis.DataTypes
```

# How to get started?
This library uses [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis) to communicate with redis db and serialize/deserialize the data using [Json.NET](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) library. You don't need to worry about serialization/deserialization of your data because it works under the hood but you need to be familiar with [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis). Well at least you need to know how to configure and instantiate [ConnectionMultiplexer](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Basics). After you learned the [Basic usage of StackExchange.Redis](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Basics) you can start using this library.

# Some code samples

* Create a ConnectionMultiplexer. Creating ConnectionMultiplexer object is costly so it is recommended to store and reuse it.

```C#
var connectionMultiplexer = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect("localhost,abortConnect=false"); // replace localhost with your redis db address
```

* You can either create a RedisType by using RedisTypeFactory or by instantiating the desired type directly. You should specify your type name so it will be stored in redis db under that name and can be accessed later.

```C#
var redisTypeFactory = new RedisTypeFactory(connectionMultiplexer);

// Create a redis dictionary under the name of "Person". (Person is a sample class with three fields (ID, Name, Age))
var redisDictionary = redisTypeFactory.GetDictionary<int, Person>("Person");
```

* Adding items to dictionary and iterate through it

```C#
redisDictionary.Add(1, new Person { ID = 1, Name = "Steve", Age = 20 });
redisDictionary.Add(2, new Person { ID = 2, Name = "Mike", Age = 25 });
redisDictionary.Add(3, new Person { ID = 3, Name = "Lara", Age = 30 });

foreach (var person in redisDictionary)
{
    Console.WriteLine("ID: {0}, Name: {1}, Age: {2}", person.Value.ID, person.Value.Name, person.Value.Age);
}
```

* Find a specific person

```C#
var lara = redisDictionary.First(kvp => kvp.Value.Name == "Lara");
Console.WriteLine("Lara's Age: {0}", lara.Value.Age);
```

* Delete a person

```C#
redisDictionary.Remove(lara.Key);
```

* Delete the Person dictionary from redis

```C#
redisDictionary.Clear();
```

* Creating a redis list without factory

```C#
var redisList = new RedisList<int>(connectionMultiplexer.GetDatabase(), "Numbers");
```

* Adding some numbers to redis list and iterate through it

```C#
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    redisList.Add(i);
}

foreach (var number in redisList)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

* Delete the Numbers list from redis

```C#
redisList.Clear();
```

* Using a DI container (This sample used [Unity](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity))

```C#
var container = new UnityContainer();

// Register connectionMultiplexer as a singleton instance
container.RegisterInstance<IConnectionMultiplexer>(connectionMultiplexer);
// Register RedisTypeFactory
container.RegisterType<IRedisTypeFactory, RedisTypeFactory>();
// Resolve an IRedisTypeFacoty
var factory = container.Resolve<IRedisTypeFactory>();

// Get a redis set from factory and add some members to it
var redisSet = factory.GetSet<int>("NumbersSet");
redisSet.Add(1);
redisSet.Add(1);
redisSet.Add(2);
```
